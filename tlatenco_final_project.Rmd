## This dataset examines tuition and cost at colleges and universities across the country. It also includes data on the diversity of US schools and post-graduation pay associated with each school.

```{r read-examine-data}
tuition_cost <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/tuition_cost.csv')

tuition_income <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/tuition_income.csv') 

salary_potential <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/salary_potential.csv')

## Question 1

#### Is private, for-profit, or public education cheaper in the Northeast or Southeast region of the U.S?

### Methods

```{r NE vs SE question 1 code}

# create variable w/ northeast states
northeast <- c("Connecticut", "Maine", "Massachusetts", "New Hampshire", "New Jersey", "New York", "Pennsylvania", "Rhode Island", "Vermont")

# create variable w/ southeast states
southeast <- c("Alabama", "Florida", "Georgia", "Arkansas", "Louisiana", "Mississippi", "North Carolina", "South Carolina", "Tennessee")

# create variable combining states from previous variables
interest_states <- c(northeast, southeast)

# start pipeline w/ appropriate data
tuition_cost %>%
  # filter for states in specified regions using saved variable combining vectors
  filter(state %in% interest_states) %>%
  # pipe mutate function to create a column that labels school by region
  mutate(us_region = if_else(state %in% northeast, "Northeast", "Southeast")) %>%
  # group schools by reigon and type of institution
  group_by(us_region, type) %>%
  # summarize by mean in state tuition under named column
  summarise(mean_in_state_tuition= mean(in_state_tuition)) %>%
  # pipe ggplot() 
  ggplot() +
  # add aes w/ x reordered and fill mapped to us_region
  aes(x = reorder(type, -mean_in_state_tuition), 
      y = mean_in_state_tuition, 
      fill = us_region) +
  # add geom_col w/ position argument
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  # add custom theme
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Type of Institution",
       y = "Mean In-State-Tuition",
       fill = "Us Region")

```


### Answer

For the three types of institutions (private, for-profit, and public), higher education is cheaper in the Southeast as visualized by the plot.
